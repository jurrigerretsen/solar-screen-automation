# Automated Somfy Tahoma Solar Screens

This repository contains scripts for automating Somfy Tahoma solar screens. The scripts interact with the Somfy API to control the solar screens based on your preferences.

## Setup

To set up the automation, you need to run the scripts in the `/setup` folder. These scripts will guide you through the process of setting up your Somfy Tahoma solar screens for automation.

For more detailed instructions on how to set up developer mode on your Somfy Tahoma device, please refer to the [Somfy TaHoma Developer Mode guide](https://github.com/Somfy-Developer/Somfy-TaHoma-Developer-Mode).
